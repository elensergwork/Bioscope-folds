# Bioscope-folds
The exact text numbers used for 10-fold cross validation in Scope negation detection papers

You can download the bioscope dataset at  http://rgai.inf.u-szeged.hu/index.php?lang=en&page=bioscope 

Text numbers correspond to ids of the original dataset file xml mark-up.


*On reproducibility and evaluation:*

1. If you are doing a token-by-token evaluation and are reporting a majority class token based F1, your tokenization matters : the authors of the paper used spacy <link> tokenizer with no additional modifications.

2. Remember that negations can overlap !

* If you have the negation cue information available at train/test time, create a cope for each negation cue present in the sentence and  mark the corresponding  negation span for each cue.  

* If you don't have the  gold cue information at train/test time the system would not be able to tell the difference between a token that is inside of multiple negations spans vs one span.  This mode of evaluation is less sound from the linguistic point of view, but important from a practical point of view (Since it is unlikely that at application time your system will have access to labeled golden negation cues)
